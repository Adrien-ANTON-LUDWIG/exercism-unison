# Instructions append

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `LinkedList`,
and implement the following functions:

- `head`
- `fromList`
- `isNil`
- `new`
- `cons`
- `nil`
- `reverseLinkedList`
- `toList`

You will find a dummy type declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type.
