# About

Unison is a statically typed, functional, and fun programming language which aims to change how programmers interact with their code.

Unison is different. ðŸ’–

Unlike many programming languages, your Unison codebase is not stored as a mutable set of text files. Instead, *each Unison definition is identified by a hash of its syntax tree.* Put another way, Unison code is content-addressed.

This change has far-reaching consequences. It simplifies distributed programming, eliminates builds and dependency conflicts, supports structured refactoring, and enables better tools when working with code.
