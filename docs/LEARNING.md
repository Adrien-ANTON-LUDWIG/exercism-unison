# Learning

The [official Unison language documentation](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/fundamentals/values-and-functions/terms/) is an excellent place to start learning. It details fundamental Unison concepts, like functions, data types, and algebraic effects.

For reference material, the [Unison language reference](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/language-reference/top-level-declaration/) contains granular details about Unison features. They're listed in the website sidebar.

You may want to familiarize yourself with [Unison Share](https://share.unison-lang.org/), Unison's repository for public libraries and projects. The documentation for the standard library, [`base`](https://share.unison-lang.org/latest/namespaces/unison/base), contains helpful usage information.

ðŸ‘‹ If you're ever stuck, we're happy to help. The #beginner-friendly channel in [the official Unison slack](http://unison-lang.org/slack) is filled with friendly people.
