# Learning

The [official Unison language documentation](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/fundamentals/values-and-functions/terms/) is an excellent place to start learning. It details fundamental Unison concepts, like functions, data types, and algebraic effects.

For reference material, the [Unison language reference](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/language-reference/top-level-declaration/) contains granular details about Unison features. They're listed in the website sidebar.

ðŸ‘‹ Also, If you're ever stuck, we're happy to help. The #beginner-friendly channel in [the official Unison slack](http://unison-lang.org/slack) is filled with friendly people.
